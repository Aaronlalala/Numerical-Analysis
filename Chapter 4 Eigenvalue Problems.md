# Intuition of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Given an n by n matrix A, it represents a linear transformation on an n-dimensional vector space. An eigenvector of a matrix determines the direction of the effect that applies. The matrix expands or shrinks any vector lying in that direction by a scalar multiple $\lambda$, which is the corresponding eigenvalue.

# Existence and Uniqueness

## Characteristic Polynomial

$det(A-\lambda I)$ is a polynomial of degree n in $\lambda$, called the characteristic polynomial of A. Its roots are the eigenvalues of A. An n by n matrix A always has n eigenvalues but may not be real and may not be distinct. The reverse is also true: for any polynomial, there is an associated matrix whose eigenvalues are the roots of the polynomial.
